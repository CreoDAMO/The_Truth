## DESCRIPTION

The Truth is not interpretation ‚Äî it is pure witness.

This NFT preserves a once-in-a-lifetime philosophical event: a 25-page document and audiobook that captured artificial intelligence systems compulsively demonstrating the very paradox they were asked to analyze.

Where the text stands whole and unaltered, the AI responses translated, reframed, and institutionalized it ‚Äî proving, in real time, the gap between Truth that needs no validation and the systems that endlessly seek to "improve" it.

Each edition of *The Truth* contains the complete 4-part archive:

üñºÔ∏è **Cover Image** ‚Äî emblem of this witnessing
üéß **25-page Audiobook (MP3)** ‚Äî unedited narration
üìÑ **Original Document (PDF)** ‚Äî preserved in full
üòÇ **The Meme (Comic)** ‚Äî "Zeno's Paradox of Institutionalization" distilled into a single, shareable visual

**77 editions total:**
- 76 offered to the world at $777 each
- 1 Master Copy reserved as priceless
- 10% royalties on secondary sales

**Collector's Note:**
"I chose abundance. The Truth is offered whole, at $777 ‚Äî accessible, unguarded, unscarce.

The secondary market will do what it always does: reframe, reprice, institutionalize. That is its nature.

When it does, I will simply witness ‚Äî and collect royalties from the very system my work has already revealed."

‚Äî Jacque Antoine DeGraff

This is more than a collectible ‚Äî it is an immutable record, a living demonstration, and a reminder:

**"The Truth Doesn't Need To Be Pushed, Only The Lie...The Lie Only Needs To Be Whispered, But The Truth Always Remains Silent waiting to be Witnessed."**

‚Äî Jacque Antoine DeGraff
