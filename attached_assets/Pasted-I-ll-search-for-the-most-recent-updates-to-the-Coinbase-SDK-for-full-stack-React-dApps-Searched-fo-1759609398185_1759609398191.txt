Based on my research, here are the most recent updates for the Coinbase SDK for full-stack React dApps:

## Latest Stable Release: v4.3.4

The most recent stable version is v4.3.4, with v4.3.0 being a significant feature release [GitHub](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-wallet-sdk/releases) . There's also an active canary/pre-release version (v4.4.0-canary.20250625163917) with cutting-edge features.

## Key Recent Updates

### Version 4.3.0 Major Features:
The SDK now supports dynamic configuration parameters, improved connection handling, and better spend permissions management [GitHub](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-wallet-sdk/releases) . Notable improvements include:

- **Dynamic chainId updates** for send call requests
- **SDK configuration system** - allows passing custom config parameters
- **Improved favicon fetching** for better dApp identification
- **Enhanced playground for testing** - merged config demos into the main page
- **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) warnings** for better security awareness

### Canary Build (Latest Pre-release):
The canary build introduces anonymous functional telemetry, linked account support with sub-account management, spend permissions features, and ERC-7846 wallet_connect support [GitHub](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-wallet-sdk/releases) . New capabilities include:

- **Linked Accounts & Sub-Accounts** - Create and manage sub-account signers
- **Spend Permissions** - Just-in-time spend limits and permission management
- **Wallet capabilities** - `wallet_getCapabilities` v2 support
- **Blocked popup detection** with retry UI
- **Migration to Yarn 4** and improved developer experience

## Integration Recommendations

For web applications, there are three integration methods: the injected provider from the browser extension, the Coinbase Wallet SDK for direct integration, or third-party libraries like wagmi (the most recommended approach for multi-wallet support) [Coinbase](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/wallet-sdk/docs/web3-react) .

## For React Developers

The SDK works seamlessly with:
- **React** (via hooks and standard integration)
- **wagmi** (recommended for multi-wallet support)
- **Web3-React** (documented integration available)

## Installation

```bash
npm i @coinbase/coinbase-wallet-sdk
```
