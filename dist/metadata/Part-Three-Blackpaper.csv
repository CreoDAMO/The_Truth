name,"The Truth Part Three - Applying The Law's & Creating The Blackpaper"
description,"The doctrinal foundation - an NFT preserving the comprehensive legal architecture that grounds The Truth ecosystem in Black's Law Dictionary principles rather than regulatory compliance frameworks.

This collection immortalizes the foundation-first approach: building upon bedrock legal doctrine (property law, trust law, fiduciary duty, contract law) before overlaying statutory requirements. The Blackpaper demonstrates how to apply Law rather than practice legal compliance.

**Core Legal Mappings:**
- NFTs as Choses in Action (intangible personal property)
- Provenance as Trust Corpus (fiduciary relationships)
- Admin Keys as Agency (corporate governance)
- Revenue as General Intangibles (UCC Article 9)
- Holder Rights as Licenses (contractual permissions)

**Equitable Maxims Applied:**
- Equity regards as done that which ought to be done
- A grantor shall not derogate from his own grant
- Trust will not fail for want of a trustee
- Between equal equities, the first in time prevails

Each edition contains the complete legal archive: Cover Image, Executive Summary Audio, Blackpaper PDF, and 3 Comics documenting the mirror effect where institutional critiques reflect their own contradictions.

**444 editions total:**
- 443 offered to the world at $1777 each
- 1 Master Copy reserved as priceless
- 10% royalties on secondary sales

**Foundation Principle:**
'You've placed framework over foundation, that is a house built on sand. I've placed foundation before framework, that is a house built on a rock.' — Jacque Antoine DeGraff

**The Doctrinal Mirror:**
Regulatory challenges to properly applied law become challenges to law itself. Any agency arguing against documented property rights, fiduciary relationships, and contractual licensing argues against the doctrinal basis of their own authority.

— Jacque Antoine DeGraff
