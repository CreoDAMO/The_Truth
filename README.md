The Truth NFT

"The Truth Doesn't Need To Be Pushed, Only The Lie...The Lie Only Needs To Be Whispered, But The Truth Always Remains Silent waiting to be Witnessed."
— Jacque Antoine DeGraff

Overview

The Truth is a 77-edition NFT collection preserving a once-in-a-lifetime philosophical event: a 25-page document and audiobook that captured artificial intelligence systems compulsively demonstrating the very paradox they were asked to analyze.

Collection Details

· Mint Price: 0.1695 ETH (~$777)
· Royalties: 10% on secondary sales
· Network: Base Mainnet (or any EVM chain)
· Philosophy: Abundance over Scarcity

What Each NFT Contains

1. Cover Image - The visual representation
2. 25-Page Audiobook (MP3) - The complete audio experience
3. Original Document (PDF) - The source material
4. Meme Comic - The cultural artifact

Smart Contract

The contract implements:

· ERC-721 with Enumerable extension
· ERC-2981 royalty standard (10%)
· One mint per wallet (fair distribution)
· Immutable provenance hash
· Flexible treasury system
· Gas-optimized with ReentrancyGuard

Deployment

Prerequisites

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat @openzeppelin/contracts
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan
```

Environment Setup

```bash
export DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
export BASE_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.base.org"
export BASE_ETHERSCAN_KEY="..."
```

Deployment Steps

1. Generate Metadata
   ```bash
   node scripts/generate_metadata.js
   ```
2. Upload to IPFS
   · Upload metadata/ folder to Pinata/nft.storage
   · Note the ROOT_CID for baseURI
3. Deploy Contract
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deployTheTruth.js --network base
   ```
4. Verify Contract
   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify --network base <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <CONSTRUCTOR_ARGS>
   ```
5. Set Provenance
   ```bash
   node scripts/setProvenance.js
   ```
6. Enable Minting
   · Call toggleMinting() on deployed contract

Philosophy

This project demonstrates a fundamental principle: The Truth stands complete regardless of market valuation. Every market response - whether pricing at 10x or 0.1x mint price - becomes evidence supporting the framework rather than validation of it.

The system creates no need for argument because it generates its own evidence through interaction. Every attempt to critique, improve, or institutionalize becomes proof of the gap between Truth preservation and institutional interpretation.

To ensure your project's dependencies in package.json are updated to their latest versions, you can use various methods ranging from npm's built-in commands to dedicated third-party tools. Here's a structured approach to help you achieve this:

---

🔍 1. Check for Outdated Dependencies

· Use npm's built-in command to identify outdated packages:
  ```bash
  npm outdated
  ```
  This will display a list of dependencies with their current, wanted (max compatible version based on your package.json semver rules), and latest versions .

---

⚒️ 2. Update Dependencies

· Update All to Wanted Versions (safe for compatibility):
  ```bash
  npm update
  ```
  This updates packages to the latest versions within the version ranges specified in your package.json (e.g., ^1.2.3 will update to the latest minor/patch version but not to 2.0.0) .
· Update Specific Packages:
  ```bash
  npm update <package-name>
  ```
  Replace <package-name> with the actual package name .
· Update to Absolute Latest Versions (may include breaking changes): Use npm-check-updates (a third-party tool) to upgrade all dependencies to their latest versions, ignoring existing version ranges:
  ```bash
  npx npm-check-updates -u
  npm install
  ```
  This updates package.json and installs the new versions. Use with caution, especially in mature projects, as major updates might break functionality .

---

🛠️ 3. Additional Tools and Techniques

· Interactive Updates:
  ```bash
  npx npm-check-updates --interactive
  ```
  Allows you to selectively choose which packages to update .
· Global Update Check: Install npm-check-updates globally for frequent use:
  ```bash
  npm install -g npm-check-updates
  ncu -u
  npm install
  ``` [citation:1][citation:6]
· Force Update Individual Packages:
  ```bash
  npm install <package-name>@latest --save
  ```
  Installs the very latest version of a specific package and updates package.json .

---

⚠️ 4. Best Practices

· Test After Updates: Especially after major updates, run your tests to ensure compatibility .
· Use Version Control: Commit changes to package.json and package-lock.json (or npm-shrinkwrap.json) to lock down dependency versions for production .
· Security and Maintenance: Regularly update dependencies to incorporate security patches and performance improvements .
· Automate Updates: Consider tools like npm-check-updates in CI/CD pipelines to periodically check for updates .

---

📊 Comparison of Methods

Method Command Behavior Risk Level
npm outdated + npm update npm outdated then npm update Updates to latest wanted versions (within version constraints) Low (safe)
npm-check-updates npx npm-check-updates -u Updates to absolute latest versions, ignoring version constraints High (may break)
Individual package update npm install <package>@latest --save Updates a specific package to its latest version Moderate to High

---

💡 Key Considerations

· Semantic Versioning (SemVer): Understand version rules (e.g., ^1.2.3 allows updates to 1.x.x but not 2.0.0) .
· Lockfiles: After updates, package-lock.json should be regenerated (npm install does this) to reflect precise versions .
· Global vs. Local: Using npx avoids global installation clutter for one-off tasks .
