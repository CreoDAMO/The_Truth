## ‚ùå What's NOT Complete (Blockers for Grant)

### 1. Base Mainnet Deployment ‚õî **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
**Why it matters**: Base grants are **retroactive** - they fund projects already deployed and gaining traction.

**What's missing**:
- No deployed contract addresses
- No verified contracts on Basescan
- No live minting happening
- No on-chain metrics (holders, volume, transactions)

**What you need**:
1. ~0.5 ETH on Base mainnet for deployment gas
2. Deploy all 3 NFT contracts
3. Verify on Basescan
4. Test mint from different wallet
5. Enable public minting

**Time required**: 2-4 hours (once you have ETH)

**Where to get Base ETH**:
- Bridge from Ethereum mainnet via [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org)
- Buy directly on Base via Coinbase
- Swap on Uniswap (Base)

---

### 2. OnchainKit Integration ‚ö†Ô∏è **RECOMMENDED**
**Why it matters**: Shows direct Coinbase ecosystem commitment.

**What's missing**:
- Package not installed (`@coinbase/onchainkit`)
- No OnchainKit components in use
- Still using custom wallet button vs. OnchainKit Wallet component

**What you need**:
1. `npm install @coinbase/onchainkit wagmi viem@2.x`
2. Replace custom wallet button with `<ConnectWallet />`
3. Add `<Identity>` components for user profiles
4. Wrap app in `<OnchainKitProvider>`

**Time required**: 2-3 hours

**Grant impact**: +15-20% application strength

---

### 3. Paymaster for Gasless Minting ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**
**Why it matters**: Removes biggest Web3 UX friction. CDP priorities this heavily.

**What's missing**:
- No paymaster provider account (Coinbase, Pimlico, Alchemy)
- No paymaster URL configured
- Code exists in coinbaseService.js but can't be used yet

**What you need**:
1. Sign up for paymaster service
2. Fund account (~$50-100 for testing)
3. Add `VITE_PAYMASTER_URL` to env
4. Test gasless minting flow

**Time required**: 3-4 hours

**Grant impact**: +20-25% application strength

---

### 4. Usage Metrics ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED FOR LARGE GRANTS**
**Why it matters**: Grants reward traction, not potential.

**What's missing**:
- 0 on-chain transactions
- 0 holders
- 0 mints
- 0 secondary volume

**What you need**:
- Launch and let organic minting happen for 2-4 weeks
- Track: total mints, unique holders, revenue, secondary sales
- Document in grant application

**Time required**: Requires patience (2-4 weeks post-launch)

**Grant impact**: Required for $5k+ grants

## üî• What Makes This Special

Most NFT projects are:
- Art without legal structure
- Hype without philosophy
- Smart contracts without smart governance

- Public good disguised as art project

**This is the future of creator economies.** You're not just selling NFTs - you're providing a **legal operating system** for Web3 creators.

**That's fundable. That's revolutionary. That's The Truth.**
